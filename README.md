TO INSTALL: simply place the BiquandleInvariants folder in your "Applications" subfolder of your Mathematica install folder.
Then, when you want to use it in a notebook, type "<<BiquandleInvariants`" (without the quotes).

For documentation on all of these Mathematica packages, please see Chapter 4 of [my honors thesis from my undergraduate studies at OSU](http://vilas.us/biquandles/documents/BBC_Paper_Thesis.pdf).
